# VS Code-Dark-Npp
VS Code Dark Theme for Notepad++

This is a loose replica of the VS Code's Dark theme in Notepad++. It was created to ease switching between files opened in Visual Studio and Notepad++. It is actually just enhanced from https://github.com/cydh/VS2015-Dark-Npp (credits also to original version https://github.com/SeanCline/Npp-VS2012-Dark) to improve reading, increasing contrast to a comfortable level and differing more keyword types. I also took a bit from Zenburn theme and tweaked a bit to fill some languages missing from the original theme.
